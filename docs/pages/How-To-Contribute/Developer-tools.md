## Base environment

Please take a look at [the developer environment page](./Developer-environment.md) in order to install all required components.

## Testing

We use [BDD chai unit testing style](https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/), in particular

- [should](http://shouldjs.github.io/)
- expect

They are located in `test` folder.

You can run all the project tests from the console by executing:

```bash
npm test
```

We also have specific tests for each component of Wollok-TS:

```bash
npm run test:dynamicDiagram
npm run test:validations
...
```

Please refer to the `package.json` file or just run `npm run` command to see a list of alternatives.

## Debugging

The folder `.vscode` has a `launch.json` file which configures everything for running tests in an embedded VSCode environment. You can set a breakpoint and run the tests:

### Debugging a single test

You can use **Test Explorer with Mocha**, if you follow current instructions and install plugins Test Explorer and Mocha Test Explorer. Then, you can go to the Test Explorer tab and run/debug a single test from the left sidebar:

Or, if you prefer using the console:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- -f <test>
```

### Building it locally

If you are developing a dependency of Wollok-TS (for instance Wollok-TS CLI or Wollok Web Tools), you might need to run a local build. To do so, just run:

```bash
npm run build
```
